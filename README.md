# Reactor Packet

This is a work in progress repository, aimed at making useful information about the various Microsoft Reactor spaces more easily available.

## Template

To add a new Reactor, just copy the template directory and replace all information in curly brackets (`{}`) and add high quality photos of the Reactor space. You can send a PR with this content and it'll get merged as long as it's complete!

## Work in Progress

This repository is currently a WIP. I'm hoping it'll be generally useful for anyone hosting an event in the various Microsoft Reactor spaces. If you have thoughts or suggestions on how it could be improved, I'm more than happy to have that feedback!
